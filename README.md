# Hi there, I'm Sebastian ðŸ‘‹
This GitHub profile is a collection of my projects and contributions to others' projects, as well as a place to share thoughts, ideas, knowledge and experiences.

I'm currently studying for a [**Master's Degree in Software Design**](https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Software-Design#specialisations) at, as well as working for, the [**IT University of Copenhagen**](http://en.itu.dk). 

My research topics / specialisations at ITU are divided into two main areas: **Technical Interaction Design** and **Software Development & Technology**. 

A significant amount of the individual *course assignments, tasks and projects* I've worked on during my studies can be found in the [list of ITU courses](https://github.com/stars/sebastianromano/lists/itu) or by searching for the `IT University of Copenhagen` keyword in [repositories](https://github.com/sebastianromano?tab=repositories&q=IT+University+of+Copenhagen&type=&language=&sort=).

Additionally, [all my other projects and contributions](https://github.com/sebastianromano?tab=repositories&q=NOT+itu&type=&language=&sort=) can be found there as well.
