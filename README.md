# Hi there, I'm Sebastian ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer currently working on solutions to provide transcriptions and AI summarizations / suggestions for a Danish company.

This GitHub profile serves as a repository for my projects and contributions to other projects. It is also a platform where I can share my thoughts, ideas, knowledge, and experiences.

Previously, I've studied at - and worked for - the [**IT University of Copenhagen**](http://en.itu.dk). During my [**Master's Degree in Software Design**](https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Software-Design#specialisations), I've focused on the areas of **Technical Interaction Design** and **Software Development & Technology**.

Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about my projects and contributions.

A considerable number of the *course assignments, tasks, and various projects* I have worked on during my studies can be found in the [list of ITU courses](https://github.com/stars/sebastianromano/lists/itu) or by searching for the keyword `IT University of Copenhagen` in my [repositories](https://github.com/sebastianromano?tab=repositories&q=IT+University+of+Copenhagen&type=&language=&sort=).

Additionally, [all my other projects and contributions](https://github.com/sebastianromano?tab=repositories&q=NOT+itu&type=&language=&sort=) can be found there as well.
