### Hi, I'm Sebastian ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying for a [**Master's Degree in Software Design**](https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Software-Design#specialisations) at, as well as working for, the [**IT University of Copenhagen**](http://en.itu.dk).

My research topics are partly focused on 
1. **Technical Interaction Design** 
2. **Software Development & Technology** 
- most of the **courses** are [featured here](https://github.com/stars/sebastianromano/lists/itu), as well as all other [**projects**](https://github.com/sebastianromano?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=) I'm currently working on / have previously worked on.
