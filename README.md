### Hi, I'm Sebastian ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying for a master's degree in [Software Design at the IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Software-Design#specialisations). My research topics are partly focused on Technical Interaction Design and Software Development & Technology - [most of the courses are uploaded here](https://github.com/stars/sebastianromano/lists/itu), along with [all other projects I'm working on](https://github.com/sebastianromano?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=).
